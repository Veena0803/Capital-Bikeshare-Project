# Capital-Bikeshare-Project

The concept of bike sharing has been popular in the US since quite some time. This service is available for use 24*7 throughout the year and riders can have access to a bike at any station across the system.
Given the environmental and health benefits many major cities have adopted this idea of bike sharing. One such system is Washington D.C’s Capital Bike Share which was started back in 2010 and has now grown to about 500 docking stations with more than 4500 bikes.
This project analyzes the various factors that influence the demand for bikes using R. 

Capital Bikeshare is operated by Motivate, a global leader in bike share. This system provides residents & visitors an affordable and convenient transportation option in D.C by helping them to rent bikes to get them from point A to point B. People use bikeshare to commute to work, school, run errands, social engagements etc. There are two types of bike sharing options available for riders: ‘casual’ – wherein the user rents a bike for a 30 minute ride or a 24 hour period, ‘registered’ – wherein the user would subscribe to a 30-day plan or an annual membership.

The project aims in analyzing various factors such as season, time of the day, day of the week, holiday, temperature, humidity, weather, windspeed etc. that influence the demand for bikes.
